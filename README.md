## Quick start

Before start hacking, is necessary to run some commands in your workspace directory:

```bash

```

## Stack

To be abble to make this project I used the following technologies:

- [Angular 4](https://angular.io/);
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/): for application scaffolding;
- [Bulma](http://bulma.io/): for flex-box based layout;
- [ngrx store](https://github.com/ngrx/store): for reactive programming;

## Prototypes

The project prototypes were made with [Adobe Experience Design Tool](http://www.adobe.com/br/products/experience-design.html) and versioned under the [prototypes directory](https://github.com/pinheirolucas/artemis/tree/master/prototypes).

I've shared the the prototype [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/6bc59021-4118-48b4-a90d-9a0191c5973f/) in case you don't have **Adobe XD** installed.
